# BigFile
i made a python script that hid the clue in one of 10 nested folders!
you'll know it's the file when you see that the first line is "THIS IS THE FIRST LINE."
except i pressed the 0 key on accident... twice...
whoops!

it's okay, according to my calculations, it's only gonna take 40 hours or so to manually search all of them. unless there's another way...?
